              <h3>Abstract</h3>
              <p>Computer vision technology has been widely applied to augment sports
                TV broadcast experience. Some of these broadcasts require accurate foreground segmentation on the outdoor sports scene, i.e., segmentation of potential sports players and highlight them. Segmentation on a full-HD video
                (1080p) resolution video stream with a high frame rate leads big challenge
                on the segmentation model. In this project, a deep learning-based framework is proposed for real-time instance segmentation.</p>
              <p>For instance, segmentation in the specific outdoor sport like golf, the framework shows an excellent performance both in speed and accuracy according to the experiments, and it’s superior to the state-of-the-art model. Moreover, it is proved that it can be used in real-time (30 FPS) broadcast TV
                with GPU acceleration. For non-specific scenes of the benchmark COCO
                dataset, its performance does not exceed the current state-of-the-art with
                respect to accuracy, but still has advantages regarding speed.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>For instance, segmentation in the specific outdoor sport like golf, the framework shows an excellent performance both in speed and accuracy according to the experiments, and it’s superior to the state-of-the-art model. Moreover, it is proved that it can be used in real-time (30 FPS) broadcast TV
                with GPU acceleration. For non-specific scenes of the benchmark COCO
                dataset, its performance does not exceed the current state-of-the-art with
                respect to accuracy, but still has advantages regarding speed.

            <p>Instance segmentation is a combination of three classic image detection
                tasks, classification, localization, and segmentation. In this thesis, the concept can be specified by two terms: (a) object detection, which contains
                classification and object localization; (b) semantic segmentation that generates a precision mask of the object. Each of the techniques is previously
                well studied.</p>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Many modern automation technology requires multi-sensor inputs for correct operations. Computer vision is one of the most import parts, and it has
                been applied in several areas, including autonomous driving, surveillance,
                and watching experience enhancement on broadcast TV. The thesis focuses
                on still camera vision for watching experience enhancement, precisely instance segmentation on sports TV broadcast streams.
                In some specific outdoor sports scenes, like golf, the audience’s watch experience could be enhanced by marking or highlighting the potential players and also their equipment. For instance, the golfer and their golf-club
                and golf-bag could be marked by precise masks covering them in a golf
                game</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>However, the main challenges for this task are segmentation accuracy and
                speed. Current instance segmentation methods can be divided into two
                parts. The first category is, one-stage object detection model for example
                YOLO [1][2][3] and Single Shot Detector (SSD) [4] combined with a computer vision segmentation algorithm like MOG2 [5] and KNN [6] background subtraction. These kinds of algorithms run at high speed, but they
                generate bad quality masks and are sometimes unstable and will be affected by some scene changes such as illumination changes and similar
                environment color changes. The second kinds of models are fully deep
                learning-based models that consist of a two-stage object detection network
                and semantic segmentation network. The main drawback of these kinds of
                deep neural network (DNN) frameworks like Mask R-CNN [7] is that they
                are only capable of running at a meager frame rate, 5-10 FPS, which is not
                enough for broadcast usage.</p>
            <h3>Existing Solutions/Competitors</h3>
            <p>We dont have any competitors. This idea is unique and there is not any market software which is doing this thing.</p>
            <h3>Proposed Solutions</h3>
            <p>The project will focus on finding and developing an instance segmentation
                for a specific outdoor sports scene, golf, that has a difference with the relevant research field to a certain extent. The proposed model is tested on
                (1) public dataset COCO which is a standard dataset that measures the accuracy performance of the model. (2) The host company-owned dataset
                contains golf scenes only. The proposed model has some generalization to
                some extent, but its performance is only maximized on the specific dataset
                for product usage. Also, speed performance is also taken into a significant
                consideration, which will have a concession on accuracy performance.</p>
